# contact-us-form

This project is a solution for the [Contact us from challenge from FrontendPro](https://www.frontendpro.dev/frontend-coding-challenges/contact-us-form-uE4XYJicVTKtJp7FS4HX). The contact form was developed using  HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React. It features a fully responsive design compatible with various devices, following the provided Figma designs for [Mobile](https://www.figma.com/design/0T5eX1C9aj3cHz6oBlNH1b/Contact-Form?node-id=20-3&t=Fz9rlsCz0bcztmR1-0) and [Desktop](https://www.figma.com/design/0T5eX1C9aj3cHz6oBlNH1b/Contact-Form?node-id=1-3&t=CQ4o8KmyCNeJS472-0).
The form submissions are handled by integrating the Web3Forms API, ensuring that responses are sent directly to the specified email.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
